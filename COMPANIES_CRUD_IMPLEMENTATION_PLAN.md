# Companies CRUD Feature - Implementation Plan

**Branch**: `companies-crud-feature`
**Status**: Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Created**: October 2025

---

## 1. Feature Overview

### Purpose
Add comprehensive company management to the CRM, enabling users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete company records
- Associate multiple contacts with a single company
- View all contacts associated with a company
- Track company-level information (owner, revenue, description)
- Search and filter companies

### Business Value
- Better organization of B2B sales pipeline
- Company-level reporting and insights
- Improved contact context and relationship mapping
- Foundation for company-level deal tracking (future feature)

### Integration Points
- **Contacts**: Many-to-one relationship (multiple contacts per company)
- **Navigation**: New "Companies" section in main nav
- **Search**: Company name search functionality
- **Future**: Company-level deals and metrics

---

## 2. Database Architecture

### Companies Table (Already Exists ‚úÖ)
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.companies (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  company_name TEXT,
  owner_name TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  annual_rev TEXT,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Fields**:
- `company_name`: Company name (REQUIRED via Zod validation)
- `owner_name`: Owner/CEO name (optional)
- `description`: Company description (optional)
- `annual_rev`: Annual revenue as TEXT for flexibility (e.g., "$1M-5M", "Not disclosed")
- `user_id`: Links to user who owns this company record

### Contact-Company Relationship Migration

**Current State**:
```sql
-- contacts table has:
company TEXT  -- Stores company name as plain text
```

**Target State**:
```sql
-- contacts table will have:
company_id UUID REFERENCES public.companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

-- deals table will also have (future-proofing):
company_id UUID REFERENCES public.companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

**Migration Strategy** (Smart Data Migration with Safety):
1. Add `company_id UUID` column to contacts (nullable)
2. Add `company_id UUID` column to deals (nullable) - future-proofing for company-level deals
3. Extract unique company names from existing `contacts.company` TEXT field
4. Create corresponding company records in `companies` table
5. Link contacts to new companies via `company_id`
6. **KEEP `contacts.company` TEXT column for 2 weeks** (safety period for verification)
7. After verification period, drop `contacts.company` TEXT column
8. Update schema.sql to reflect changes

**Rollback Strategy**:
```sql
-- If migration fails or needs rollback:
UPDATE public.contacts SET company_id = NULL;
-- Investigate issues and retry migration
-- Original contacts.company column remains intact during safety period
```

### Row Level Security (Already Complete ‚úÖ)
```sql
-- Users can only access their own companies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own companies" ON public.companies
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own companies" ON public.companies
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own companies" ON public.companies
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own companies" ON public.companies
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Migration (with Safety Measures)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (October 18, 2025)
**Files**: `supabase/schema.sql`, migration scripts
**Results**: 13 companies created, 20 contacts linked, 0 orphans, 100% data integrity

**Tasks**:
1. Add `company_id UUID` column to contacts table (nullable)
2. Add `company_id UUID` column to deals table (nullable) - **future-proofing**
3. Create data migration script:
   - Extract unique company names from `contacts.company`
   - Create company records with `company_name` field
   - Link contacts to companies via `company_id`
4. Verify data integrity
5. **KEEP `contacts.company` column for 2-week safety period**
6. After verification, drop `contacts.company` TEXT column
7. Update `schema.sql` documentation

**SQL Migration Script**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Add columns (NON-DESTRUCTIVE)
ALTER TABLE public.contacts
ADD COLUMN company_id UUID REFERENCES public.companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE public.deals
ADD COLUMN company_id UUID REFERENCES public.companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Step 2: Migration logic (execute via Supabase SQL Editor)
-- Extract unique company names and create company records
-- Link contacts to companies via company_id

-- Step 3: VERIFICATION PERIOD (2 weeks)
-- Keep contacts.company column intact

-- Step 4: After verification, drop old column
-- ALTER TABLE public.contacts DROP COLUMN company;  -- ONLY after verified!
```

**Rollback Plan**:
```sql
-- If issues arise during safety period:
UPDATE public.contacts SET company_id = NULL;
-- Original data remains in contacts.company column
-- Investigate and retry migration
```

### Phase 2: Validation Schema (with Unicode Support)
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: `client/src/utils/validation.js`

**Task**: Create `companySchema` with Zod and **Unicode regex** for international company names

```javascript
export const companySchema = z.object({
  company_name: z.string()
    .min(2, 'Company name must be at least 2 characters')
    .max(200, 'Company name must not exceed 200 characters')
    .regex(/^[\p{L}\p{N}\s&.,'\-()]+$/u, 'Company name contains invalid characters'),
    // ^\p{L} allows all Unicode letters (supports international names)
    // \p{N} allows all Unicode numbers
    // Supports: "Caf√© Pierre" (French), "Êù±‰∫¨Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ" (Japanese), "L√∂wenbr√§u" (German)

  owner_name: z.string()
    .min(2, 'Owner name must be at least 2 characters')
    .max(100, 'Owner name must not exceed 100 characters')
    .optional()
    .or(z.literal('')),

  description: z.string()
    .max(1000, 'Description must not exceed 1000 characters')
    .optional()
    .or(z.literal('')),

  annual_rev: z.string()
    .max(100, 'Annual revenue must not exceed 100 characters')
    .optional()
    .or(z.literal(''))
});
```

**Why Unicode**: Allows global company names with accents, non-Latin scripts, and international characters. Critical for B2B CRM used internationally.

### Phase 3: Core UI Components
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: 7 new component files
**Package Installation**: `npm install react-select`

**Tasks**:
1. Install React Select library: `npm install react-select`
2. Create CompanyCard.js (display component)
3. Create CompanyDropdown.js (reusable searchable dropdown using React Select) ‚≠ê NEW
4. Create AddCompanyForm.js (modal with orange theme)
5. Create EditCompanyModal.js (edit modal)
6. Create CompanySearch.js (search bar)
7. Create CompaniesContainer.js (main page with infinite scroll)
8. Test CRUD operations work

**Infinite Scroll Implementation**:
```javascript
// In CompaniesContainer.js
const loadMore = async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('companies')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .range(companies.length, companies.length + 19);

  setCompanies(prev => [...prev, ...data]);
};

// Use IntersectionObserver or react-infinite-scroll-component
```

### Phase 4: Company Detail Page (with JOIN Queries)
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: `CompanyPage.js`

**Tasks**:
1. Create CompanyPage component
2. Fetch company data by ID from URL params
3. Fetch associated contacts with JOIN query to show company name:
```javascript
const { data: contacts } = await supabase
  .from('contacts')
  .select('*, companies(company_name, id)')
  .eq('company_id', companyId)
  .eq('user_id', user.id);
```
4. Display edit/delete actions
5. Show associated contacts grid
6. Handle navigation to ContactsPage

**Performance Note**: Using JOIN prevents N+1 query problem (single query instead of individual lookups).

### Phase 5: Navigation & Integration (with JOIN Queries)
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: `NavBar.js`, `App.js`, `AddContactForm.js`, `EditContactModal.js`, `ContactCard.js`, `ContactsPage.js`, `ContactsContainer.js`

**Tasks**:

**1. Navigation (NavBar.js)**:
- Add "Companies" link **BEFORE** "Contacts"
- New order: Dashboard ‚Üí **Companies** ‚Üí Contacts ‚Üí Deals ‚Üí Reports
- Rationale: Companies are organizational level above individual contacts

**2. Routing (App.js)**:
```javascript
<Route path="/dashboard/companies" element={<CompaniesContainer user={user} />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/companies/:id" element={<CompanyPage />} />
```

**3. Contact Forms Integration (with CompanyDropdown)**:

**AddContactForm.js**:
- Import and use CompanyDropdown component (React Select)
- Fetch user's companies on mount
- Optional selection (can create contact without company)
- Submit with `company_id` field
- CompanyDropdown handles searchability and "Create new" option

**EditContactModal.js**:
- Import and use CompanyDropdown component (React Select)
- Pre-populate with existing company (if associated)
- Allow changing or removing company association
- Consistent UX with AddContactForm

**4. Display Company on Contacts (with JOIN Queries)**:

**ContactsContainer.js**:
- Update main query to use JOIN (prevent N+1):
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('contacts')
  .select('*, companies(company_name, id)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);
```

**ContactCard.js**:
- Display company name from JOIN: `contact.companies?.company_name`
- No additional queries needed per card (performance optimization)

**ContactsPage.js**:
- Show company info in contact details from JOIN query
- Make company name clickable (Link to `/dashboard/companies/${companyId}`)

### Phase 6: Delete Company Logic
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: `CompanyPage.js`, `CompanyCard.js`

**Delete Behavior**: Cascade Nullify
- When company deleted, set all linked `contact.company_id = NULL`
- Contacts remain in system, just unlinked from company

**Implementation**:
```javascript
async function handleDelete() {
  // Check for associated contacts
  const { data: contacts } = await supabase
    .from('contacts')
    .select('id')
    .eq('company_id', companyId);

  // Show confirmation if contacts exist
  if (contacts && contacts.length > 0) {
    const confirmed = window.confirm(
      `${contacts.length} contacts are linked to this company. They will be unlinked. Continue?`
    );
    if (!confirmed) return;
  }

  // Delete company (RLS + ON DELETE SET NULL handles contact unlinking)
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('companies')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', companyId);

  if (error) {
    toast.error(handleSupabaseError(error));
  } else {
    toast.success(`Company deleted. ${contacts.length} contacts unlinked.`);
    navigate('/dashboard/companies');
  }
}
```

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
**Status**: Pending
**Files**: Various, plus `CLAUDE.md`

**Tasks**:
1. Test all CRUD operations
2. Verify RLS security (users can't access others' companies)
3. Test contact-company relationships
4. Run accessibility audit (maintain 100/100 Lighthouse)
5. Test search functionality
6. Test delete cascade nullify
7. Verify optimistic UI updates
8. Update `CLAUDE.md` with Companies feature docs

## 5. Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Only company_name Required
**Rationale**: Users may not always have complete company information (owner, revenue, description). Requiring only the company name allows quick data entry and progressive information gathering.

### Decision 2: Smart Data Migration
**Rationale**: Automatically creating companies from existing contact.company TEXT values preserves data and saves users manual re-entry work. The migration is reversible if issues arise.

### Decision 3: Full Detail Page (CompanyPage.js)
**Rationale**: Following the pattern of ContactsPage and DealPage, a dedicated detail view provides space for associated contacts list and future company-level metrics/deals. More scalable than modal-only approach.

### Decision 4: Delete Cascade Nullify
**Rationale**:
- Contacts are valuable and shouldn't be deleted with company
- Setting company_id to NULL preserves data integrity
- Users can re-associate contacts later if needed
- More forgiving than blocking deletion or cascading delete

### Decision 5: Orange/Amber Theme
**Rationale**: Establishes clear visual hierarchy:
- Blue: Contacts (people)
- Green: Deals (money)
- Purple: Notes (information)
- Orange: Companies (organizations)

### Decision 6: React Select for Searchable Dropdown
**Rationale**:
- Professional, accessible searchable dropdown component
- Handles keyboard navigation automatically
- Supports custom options like "Create new company"
- Better UX than native HTML select for users with many companies
- Widely used, well-maintained library

### Decision 7: Infinite Scroll Over Pagination
**Rationale**:
- Better mobile UX (no need to tap "Next" button)
- Faster browsing for users scanning many companies
- Consistent with modern SaaS applications
- Simpler implementation than pagination UI
- Graceful handling of large datasets

### Decision 8: Unicode Regex for International Support
**Rationale**:
- CRM should support global businesses with non-ASCII company names
- `/^[\p{L}\p{N}\s&.,'\-()]+$/u` allows French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic names
- Prevents blocking legitimate international companies
- No performance penalty for supporting Unicode
- Future-proof for global expansion

### Decision 9: JOIN Queries to Prevent N+1 Problem
**Rationale**:
- Single query with JOIN faster than N individual lookups
- Supabase supports foreign key expansion: `.select('*, companies(company_name)')`
- Reduces database load significantly (1 query vs potentially 100+)
- Better scalability as user's contact list grows
- Industry best practice for performance optimization

### Decision 10: Add company_id to Deals Table Now
**Rationale**:
- Future-proofs for company-level deals feature
- Avoids second migration later
- Minimal cost to add column now (nullable, no data)
- Allows deals to be associated with company OR contact OR both
- Enables richer reporting capabilities when needed
